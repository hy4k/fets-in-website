# Project: `fets.in` AI Assistant Evolution â€“ "Athena"

## 1. Core Concept:

*   **Primary Purpose:** To evolve from a basic FAQ bot into "Athena," an intelligent, proactive, and personalized academic success partner for students using `fets.in`. Athena will not only answer questions but also guide users, offer tailored advice, and help them navigate their educational journey seamlessly.
*   **Intended Audience:** Primarily students preparing for various exams and certifications offered or supported through `fets.in`. Secondarily, prospective students or users seeking information about the platform's services.
*   **Problems Solved/Value Provided:**
    *   Drastically reduce the need for manual support by resolving a high percentage of queries automatically.
    *   Enhance student engagement and preparedness through personalized study tips and proactive guidance.
    *   Simplify complex processes like exam scheduling and resource discovery.
    *   Provide a consistent, knowledgeable, and empathetic support experience, 24/7.
    *   Increase user satisfaction and loyalty to the `fets.in` platform.

## 2. Definition of "One of the Best" (Project Athena Goals):

Achieving "one of the best" status for Athena means meeting the following benchmarks and capabilities:

*   **Performance Benchmarks:**
    *   **Query Resolution:** Achieve **90% automated query resolution** for common and moderately complex student inquiries.
    *   **Response Time:** Average response time under 3 seconds for most interactions.
    *   **Accuracy:** >95% accuracy in information provided and actions taken.
*   **Unique Capabilities:**
    *   **Personalized Study Tips:** Dynamically generate and suggest study tips based on user's stated goals, progress (if trackable), and common challenges for specific exams.
    *   **Proactive Exam Scheduling Advice:** Monitor (with user consent) relevant factors (e.g., stated exam dates, typical preparation times) and offer timely advice on when to book exams, considering availability.
    *   **Personalized Study Plan Generation:** Offer foundational study plan templates that users can customize, or (as a stretch goal) generate more dynamic plans based on user input and learning pace.
    *   **Deep Knowledge Integration:** Understand the nuances of different exams (ACCA, CMA US, IELTS, etc.) and platform services.
*   **User Experience Standards:**
    *   **"Feels like talking to a knowledgeable human tutor":** Empathetic, natural, and contextually aware conversations.
    *   **Intuitive Interaction:** Easy to use, with clear communication and minimal user effort.
    *   **Trust and Reliability:** Users feel confident in the information and assistance provided.
*   **Competitive Differentiators:**
    *   A truly personalized and proactive assistant that goes beyond reactive Q&A.
    *   Seamless integration with `fets.in` platform functionalities.
    *   A learning system that continuously improves based on user interactions.

## 3. Current Status, Resources, and Constraints:

*   **Current AI State:** Basic FAQ bot for students.
*   **Team:**
    *   2 Backend Developers
    *   1 Frontend Developer
*   **Existing Technology Stack (Assistant):** Python, RASA.
*   **Target Timeline:** 6 months for significant demonstrable upgrade towards "Athena" capabilities.
*   **Known Constraints:**
    *   Small team size necessitates focused effort and prioritization.
    *   The 6-month timeline requires an agile approach with clear milestones.
    *   Leveraging the existing Python/RASA stack where possible is efficient, but we must be open to augmenting it if needed for advanced features.

## 4. Development Stages & Lifecycle (Project Athena Roadmap):

We will adopt an agile, iterative approach. The 6-month target will be broken down into sprints focusing on delivering incremental value.
